# Memory Game (WIP)

This is the classic memory game with cards where players can test their memory skills by correctly selecting matching cards. 

This project uses React for the front-end and the back-end was created with Node and Express. 

The project was inspired by Memory Card Game - JavaScript Tutorial by freeCodeCamp.org.

## Getting Started
Use npm install to install all of the project dependencies. Include a .env file and define the PUBLIC_URL so the card images will be displayed. 

Use npm start and then head to your browser to play!
